# CryptoniteDemo

This project was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and depends on the following:

GNU GMP (https://gmplib.org/), Intel SGX (https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx), and Intel's port of GNU GMP for SGX (https://github.com/intel/sgx-gmp).

After installing the dependencies, simply type 'make' to build in the v1 or v2 directories.
